# Whatsapp Clone

Based on knowledge acquired from a Backend Workshop, I created a personal project to further my understanding of React and Express.\
This is a simple group chat which allows anyone to join and send their messages, with the front end simulating WhatsApp theme.

## Host locally

1. Cloning the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ndqchi/whatsapp-clone.git
```
2. Enter the client and server folders then install all dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install
cd ../server
npm install
```
3. Run the server
*(assume you are in server folder)*

```bash
node index.js
```
4. Navigate to client folder and start the page
```bash
npm start
```
